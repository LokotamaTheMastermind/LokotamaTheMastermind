# Hey, I'm Oyedeji

**PS**: After years of procastinating on making this site, I've finally done it.

I'm a designer and have an eye for catchy designs. I'm also a full-stack developer and I love to code (in JavaScript/TypeScript particularly).

I'm a big fan of the Nuxt (it's what I used to build this site) and I'm currently learning responsive website design, SEO (search engine optimization), how to load websites faster and photography (thought I'll just sneak it in).
